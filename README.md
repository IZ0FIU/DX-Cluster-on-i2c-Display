# DX-Cluster-on-i2c-Display 4x20
With this project you can read DX spot of DX Cluster on Display i2x 4x20 on Raspberry PI. If you have a different display, more example 2x16, you must change parameters on file python. But it's not tested. 
I don't guarantee the correct visualization

For first you must install telnetlib for use telnet with dxcluster node:

# sudo apt-get install telnet

Now, for display you must install i2c library:

# sudo pip install RPLCD

In file python you must enter node address, port number and you OM or swl callsign

N.B. I'm a newbie on python and programmation in general. If there are error or stupid string of program, please, send me a report
Thank you
